As a software developer, I strive to make creative tools and solutions.
My primary skill-set is server-side web development, but I am a fast
learner who enjoys new challenges and I hope to expand to font-end
development as well.

I believe in accessibility, progressive enhancement, test driven development,
and clear, expressive documentation. I believe in working with my team
to solve problems and learning from them.

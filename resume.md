As a software developer, I strive to make creative tools and solutions.
My primary skill-sets are server-side web development in Ruby on Rails
and responsive front-end web page construction through modular CSS. I am
a fast learner who enjoys new challenges and I hope to expand my
familiarity with modern front-end frameworks.

I believe in accessibility, progressive enhancement, test driven development,
and clear, expressive documentation. I believe in working with my team
to solve problems and learning from them.


## Education & Background

### Roostify
*March 2017 - Present*

Senior full stack rails developer at Roostify, a digital mortgage
platform, working on client-configurable infrastructure. I led a
redesign of the email configuration system for white label branding and
helped bring the application UI up to WCAG 2.0 AA standards.

As a team lead on a critical project that fundamentally extended our
application’s capabilities, I  ensured that my team’s technical
requirements were effectively communicated to others. I re-architected
one of our core systems to scale with a new data model, allowing our
system to work with a dynamic range of users.

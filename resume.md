As a full-stack web developer, I strive to make tools and experiences
that help others and that are available and accessible to everyone. I am
currenty looking for a role where I have an impact on people directly.

I have over 6 years of experience working with Ruby and Rails and
semantic HTML and CSS, and I hope to expand my familiarity with modern
front-end frameworks.

I believe in accessibility, progressive enhancement, test driven development,
and clear, expressive documentation. I believe in working with my team
to solve problems and learning from them.


## Experience

### Roostify
*March 2017 - Present*

Senior full stack Rails developer at Roostify, a digital mortgage
platform, working on client-configurable infrastructure. As a team lead
on a critical project that fundamentally extended our application’s
capabilities, I ensured that my team’s technical requirements were
effectively communicated to others. I re-architected several of our core
systems to scale with a new data model, managing system-wide conflicts
with other teams over a period of 12 months.

I have coordinated with designers and product managers to help advise
and define new features, such as rebuilding the email and style
configuration system for a white-labelled product and bringing the
application UI up to WCAG 2.0 AA standards.

### Builder Code Works
*April 2016 - March 2017*

Front end and Rails developer contracting with Builder Code Works, a
Pittsburgh web development consultancy. I worked with a small team to
create business, educational, and artistic web applications in Rails and
React.

Clients include:

- *Texas A&M* - designed the data store for and built a React application
  for teachers to interact with an online tutoring system.
- [The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh](http://www.carnegielibrary.org/) -
  designed an intuitive form to interact with installation art, focusing
  on teaching children about HTTP requests.
- [ViaHero](https://www.viahero.com/) - created an accessible multi-step
  wizard to help travelers hire tour guides.
- [Code & Supply](https://codeandsupply.co/) - architected a membership
  system and integrated it with Stripe to support a local community
  workspace.


### Webkite
*September 2010 - May 2013*

Rails developer at Webkite, a faceted search platform for product
comparison. While there I was responsible for establishing an acceptance
test suite, upgrading major Rails versions, and mentoring team members
to bring them up to speed with the codebase and best practices. I also
created new facets in the architecture, maintained a product import
service, and collaborated remotely with designers to implement the
application’s user interface.

### Zeta Labs
*March 2010 - September 2010*

Tech consultant for Zeta Labs, an independent design team, where I built
websites for small businesses and non-profit organizations. The primary
focus of my work was maintaining client sites and developing Wordpress
plugins and themes. Clients include: Talking Tree Creative, Deja Blake,
Dr. David McDowell, HealthCorps, Baum Youth Forum, Urban Wellness, and
Society for Martial Arts Instruction.

### University of Pittsburgh
*August 2005 - December 2009*

BS in Computer Engineering

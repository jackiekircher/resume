==============

I am a hardworking person who likes to create useful things to help
other people. My primary skillset is in server-side web development
but I am a fast learner and am hoping to expand into front-end
development as well. I seek out a variety of challenges in order to
constantly improve.

### Beliefs

  I believe that the web must be accessible to everyone, including those
  with disabilites and those without javascript.

  I know that diversity and respect for others is key to producing
  successful solutions.

  I practice test driven development, clear documentation, consistent code
  styles, and expressiveness in my commit and issue management.

  I want to refactor my code and have it reviewed by my peers so that I
  make fewer mistakes and can learn.

### For Fun

  one's health but that it is also essential for personal growth. In addition
  to web programming, I have also:

  - made open source games ([Ascii Ascii Revolution](https://github.com/jackiekircher/AsciiAsciiRevolution), [VimCity](https://github.com/jackiekircher/VimCity))
  - modded video games ([Specorgi](https://github.com/jackiekircher/specorgi))
  - performed fire dancing and eating with [Steel Town Fire](http://steeltownfire.org/)
  - taught fire dancing classes at retreats

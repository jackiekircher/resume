As a software developer, I strive to make creative tools and solutions.
My primary skill-sets are server-side web development in Ruby on Rails
and responsive front-end web page construction through modular CSS. I am
a fast learner who enjoys new challenges and I hope to expand my
familiarity with modern front-end frameworks.

I believe in accessibility, progressive enhancement, test driven development,
and clear, expressive documentation. I believe in working with my team
to solve problems and learning from them.

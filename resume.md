As a software developer, I strive to make creative tools and solutions.
My primary skill-set is server-side web development, but I am a fast
learner who enjoys new challenges and I hope to expand to font-end
development as well.

I believe in accessibility, progressive enhancement, test driven development,
and clear, expressive documentation. I believe in working with my team
to solve problems and learning from them.

### For Fun

  I believe that venturing out into other fields is not only good for
  one's health but that it is also essential for personal growth. In addition
  to web programming, I have also:

  - drawn comics ([zerglings as cats](http://zerglingsascats.com))
  - made open source games ([Ascii Ascii Revolution](https://github.com/jackiekircher/AsciiAsciiRevolution), [VimCity](https://github.com/jackiekircher/VimCity))
  - modded video games ([Specorgi](https://github.com/jackiekircher/specorgi))
  - performed fire dancing and eating with [Steel Town Fire](http://steeltownfire.org/)
  - taught fire dancing classes at retreats
